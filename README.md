## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### A lot of the Tweaks/Extensions are already available as Single Plugins ###
Of course! But as a professional Web Agency it is much easier to develope, maintain and audit a single plugin instead of a set of 20+ plugins from different authors!

### Why do you use your custom tracking code for Piwik/Google Analytics ###
Because of the Opt-Out Buttons code and the possibility to control the options via the settings page.

### I miss some features / I found a bug ###
